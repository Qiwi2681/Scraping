This was my second scraping project, I learned a lot.
This code is  a mish-mash of that learning, some files are incomplete/unused.

Important files:

driver_manager.py & driver_manager2.py - Parallel selenium tasks

arb.py - Scrape functions, using BS4 + JS. Contains SteamBot() as well..

run.py - Submits scrape task

listing_sort.py - Graphs the contents of a given item.csv

excecuting arb.py - This was used for currency arbitrage, submits a scrape task but expecting variable currency.
