This was my second scraping project, I learned a lot.
This code is  a mish-mash of that learning, some files are incomplete/unused.

Important files:

run.py - Submits scrape task

listing_sort.py - Graphs the contents of a given item.csv

arb.py - I think this was intended for currency arbitrage, submits a scrape task but on multiple accounts.
