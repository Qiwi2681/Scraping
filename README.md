1. Google - My first introduction to selenium
2. Reddit - Exploring multi-threading and server (raspberry pi) optimisation
3. Steam - Store persistent steam accounts across threads

Note: Steam turned into [SteamBot](https://github.com/qiwi1272/SteamBot), as such it contains unused files.

Stored ~80 GB uncompressed over a few days on 8 threads.<br />
